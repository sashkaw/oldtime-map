Visitors have an opportunity to learn and observe first hand these traditions.<br> <br>Anyone who plays and would like to share their talents can join in the music gathering regardless of playing level even beginner musicians. The jams will follow an “around-the-circle” format, where folks may lead tunes/songs or pass the tune choice to the next person. “We hope people will get their instrument and come on out to enjoy a step back in time with us.”          <br><br>Updated CR 7/15/2022                                           ", "date_guess": "third Saturday", "type_guess": "weekly gathering" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -83.4895449, 35.6117644, 0.0 ] } },
